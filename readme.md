LootGO – The Real-World Crypto Treasure Hunt

aka. PokémonGO with crypto rewards

Turn your daily steps into loot. 
Walk around IRL, collect and open lootboxes for memecoins, raffle tickets, whitelist spots, and more — all while becoming healthier and wealthier!

LootGO’s gameplay powers “location-based airdrops” — creating a powerful distribution channel for crypto projects and retail brands through direct, on-the-ground user engagement.

## cPOP Creator

With **cPOP integration**, **any creator can mint and distribute cPOP tokens (compressed SPL tokens) directly through our map**—rewarding users for showing up at physical events, booths, or stores with a verifiable proof of presence. Great for activating communities, tracking attendance, or distributing perks.

**Creator portal (for organizers):**

1. Connect wallet and fill in event details (title, description, location).
2. That’s it! We mint and manage the cPOP campaign on-chain.

**Player app (for users):**

1. Find cPOP badges on the LootGO map with event info.
2. Walk into the geo-fence, tap “Check-In,” and scan the on-site QR.
3. Receive the compressed token (cPOP) instantly via lootbox.
